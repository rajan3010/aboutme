<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented based on the IEEE paper "Semantic Image Inpainting using Deep Generative Models</li>
			<li>Auto generated incomplete patches in an image.</li>
			<li>Designed a DCGAN network in python using tensorflow.</li>
			<li>Trained and tested using CelebA_HQ dataset</li>
			<li>Preprocessed and trained 10k images over the network for 8000 iterations using Cuda and CuDnn</li>
			<li>Obtained a reduced loss when compared to other conventional image restoration techniques like auto encoders.</li>
		</ul>
