		<ul>
			<li>Aligned the images in prehand for proper blending using OpenCV and Python</li>
			<li>Generated the gaussian and laplacian pyramids from the source and target images.</li>
			<li>Developed a GUI for the source image, where the user could interact to choose the type of mask to be applied (rectangle or freeform).</li>
			<li>Generated gaussian pyramids for the mask and mask complements.</li>
			<li>Applied pyramid blending algorithm to get the final blended images.</li>
