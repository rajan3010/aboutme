		<ul>
			<li>Implemented and trained a VAE from inertial sensing data (accelormeter, gyrometer) using Keras, TensorFlow in python</li>
			<li>Used the latent space variables from the VAE to train a CRF model followed by LSTM for gait prediction.Obtained a final F1 score of 0.75 and finished second in the leaderboard. (Competition Project)</li>
