description: I am passionate about software development. I love to create things and I get excited while discovering anything related to robots or technology. I am adaptable and I love programming in different language (Also its my dream to build an intelligent software that could translate programs between different languages sometime in future). With a software development background and huge interest towards AI, I am currently pursuing my Masters at NC State to hone those skills.
